/*
In Salesforce, Apex is a strongly-typed, object-oriented programming language that can be used to write custom business logic. 
You can write Apex code to find duplicate records in an object by querying the object, comparing records, and adding duplicates to a list.
Here's a simple example:
*/
public class DuplicateRecordFinder {
    public static void findDuplicates(List<SObject> records) {
        Map<String, SObject> uniqueRecords = new Map<String, SObject>();
        List<SObject> duplicateRecords = new List<SObject>();

        for (SObject record : records) {
            String key = '';
            // Use a unique identifier such as a name or email to identify duplicates
            key = (String)record.get('Name');
            if (uniqueRecords.containsKey(key)) {
                duplicateRecords.add(record);
            } else {
                uniqueRecords.put(key, record);
            }
        }
        System.debug(duplicateRecords);
    }
}

/*
In this example, the findDuplicates method takes a list of records as an input and compares them using a unique identifier, 
in this case the Name field. If a record with the same identifier already exists in the uniqueRecords map,
it is added to the duplicateRecords list. The duplicates can then be processed or deleted as needed.

Note that this example uses a simple approach for finding duplicates and may not be suitable for all use cases.
You may need to adjust the code to fit the specific requirements of your data and duplicate detection logic.
